## 🎯 **Ready-to-Execute Campaign Plan**

### **Phase 1: Team Assignment (Day 1)**
```bash
# Management Actions:
1. Review assignments: evidence/syntax_triage/syntax_fix_assignments_*.md
2. Create GitHub issues: evidence/syntax_triage/github_issues_*.json
3. Assign top 5 files to senior developers (666 errors = 34% impact)
4. Set 48-hour deadline for critical file completion

# Team Lead Actions:
1. Accept file assignments from triage report
2. Use provided commands to identify specific syntax errors
3. Focus on highest-count files first for maximum impact
```

### **Phase 2: Execution Tracking (Days 1-7)**
```bash
# Daily Progress Monitoring:
python scripts/track_syntax_fix_progress.py

# Weekly Executive Reporting:  
python scripts/generate_weekly_syntax_report.py

# Individual Developer Workflow:
python -m py_compile app/services/your_file.py  # Identify errors
# [Manual fixes - cannot be automated]
ruff check app/services/your_file.py           # Validate fixes
```

### **Phase 3: Completion Validation (Day 7+)**
```bash
# Infrastructure Validation:
python scripts/validate_ruff_infrastructure.py

# CI Testing:
# Create small test PR to verify P0 blocking is resolved

# Campaign Success Metrics:
# Syntax errors: 1,950 → 0 (100% complete)
# CI Status: 🔴 BLOCKED → 🟢 PASSING
```
